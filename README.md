# How many days till Santa comes?

## Deployed application link

## Description

A simple desktop application counting down the days until Christmas üéÑüéÖüèºüéÅ

I worked on this small project to practice the use of Day.js, as well as adding some fun audio event listeners. The countdown will stop on Christmas Day, displaying a festive message. Enjoy!

## Instllation

N/A

## Usage

This application is not mobile friendly yet, although I'd like to re-work it to make it more accessible for next year. Here's what it looks like at the moment:

## Credits

The main functionality of the countdown is from a tutorial by DCode: Build a "Days Until" Countdown Timer with HTML, CSS & JavaScript - Beginner's Project Tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zr2kBYzcJ14)

I have then added my own sparkle to the basic timer built through it ‚ú®
